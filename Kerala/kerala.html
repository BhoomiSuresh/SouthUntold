      <p class="expkl"><span>Explore Kerala</span> <br><br> Known as ‘God’s Own Country’, picturesque Kerala is a must on any travel bucket list. 
        The more laidback pace of life is the perfect introduction to India and is a stark contrast 
        to bustling destinations such as the Golden Triangle. This wonderful state right at the bottom of India 
        has so much to offer, from tantalising cuisine, wonderful wildlife, mesmerising culture and lots to explore.<br>
        Kerala, famous especially for its ecotourism initiatives and beautiful backwaters hosts many tourist places 
        that attract people from far and wide. Its unique culture and traditions, and its varied demography, have made
        Kerala one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. Kerala's tourist places are a visual treat 
        for the tourists, the sunny beaches, famed backwaters, serene hill stations, roaring waterfalls, great 
        greenery, large tea & spice plantations and large coconut groves offer a wonderful experience for the visitors.
