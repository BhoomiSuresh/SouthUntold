      <p class="expkl"><span>Explore Goa</span> <br><br> Goa is a state on the southwestern coast of India within the Konkan region, geographically separated from the Deccan highlands 
        by the Western Ghats. It is bound by the Indian states of Maharashtra to the north, and 
        Karnataka to the east and south, with the Arabian Sea in the west. It is India's smallest
         state by area and fourth-smallest by population.Most of the beauty of Goa is present on 
         the beaches. The coastline of about 103 kilometres (64 mi) has some of the most 
         attractive beaches flanked by the Arabian Sea.Having been a Portuguese territory for 
         over 450 years, Goan culture is an amalgamation of both Eastern and Western styles, with
          the latter having a more dominant role.
